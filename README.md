CCTV Management System for Green Link Technologies - Order Management


This order management function consists of two main parts. It identifies the customer entering
the system and placing an order and the order being handled by the order manager. Here the
customer can first select the product he wants, change its quantity as he wants and enter his
data as requested by the system so that he can easily place the order correctly. The customer
can then receive a bill for the item he has requested through the auto-generated bill by the
system. If the customer has a change of opinion regarding the purchase of the product, a
message regarding the removal of the order can be sent to the order manager. If the customer
attempts to purchase goods on a cash-on-delivery basis, the manager has the ability to remove
that order from the system. The order manager, the other side of the function, then verifies the
customer's details regarding the order and if the accuracy is successful, the order will be
transferred to the delivery party. As mentioned earlier, if the order manager has a message
regarding the customer removing the order, the order manager will cancel the order.
